# How Orders Are Fetched
- On the first day of the month, the whole previous month's orders are fetched.
    - On October 1st, orders from 1 - 30 Sept are fetched.
- The equation: firstDayOfTheMonth until currentDay - 1 (yesterday)

# Notes
- time_from and time_to on v2.order.get_order_list spans at maximum 14 days,
should think of the workaround
