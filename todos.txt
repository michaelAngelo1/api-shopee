## Deployment
- Vercel?

# AUTHORIZATION
- Authorization is, gratefully, valid for 365 days hehe.
- Access token is invalid after 4 hours. How to get a new one? v
- Refresh token is invalid after 30 days. How to get a new one? v

# API
- Get order list v
- Get order detail: REQUIRE customer detail, address, product bought, order value, etc. 
Current order detail lacks details. v
- Run the Get order list & Get order detail DAILY (see How Orders Are Fetched)
- Process the data according to BigQuery data structure
- Merge / Write to BigQuery
    - require table Order List Status Changes Log
        - order_sn
        - status
        - updated_at
    if status changed, REPLACE previous order_sn with the latest order_sn,
    so eileen_grace_orders_log should include UNIQUE order_sn with latest status.
    - require table Order Detail List
        - order_sn

# How Orders Are Fetched
- On the first day of the month, the whole previous month's orders are fetched.
    - On October 1st, orders from 1 - 30 Sept are fetched.
- The equation: firstDayOfTheMonth until currentDay - 1 (yesterday)

# Scaling up
- Replicate the same thing for other brands.
- Shopee: might need more App for each brand.
- Backend: should scale to accommodate 16 brands

# Reliability
- DATA MATCHED. Check if order data matches that of Shopee's. (try comparing first & last order) v
    - Order is not sorted by datetime
    - Earliest order fetched has id 250901AE5EY3DY and IS timely correct. v
    - Latest order fetched has id 250924A236C19G and IS timely correct. v
- Auto-retrying operations if network is bad or fails the first time.
