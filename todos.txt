TODOS:

# AUTHORIZATION
- Authorization is, gratefully, valid for 365 days hehe.
- Access token is invalid after 4 hours. How to get a new one? v
- Refresh token is invalid after 30 days. How to get a new one? v

# API
- Get order list v
- Get order detail v
- Run the Get order list & Get order detail DAILY (see How Orders Are Fetched)
- Process the data according to BigQuery data structure
- Merge / Write to BigQuery

# How Orders Are Fetched
- On the first day of the month, the whole previous month's orders are fetched.
    - On October 1st, orders from 1 - 30 Sept are fetched.
- The equation: firstDayOfTheMonth until currentDay - 1 (yesterday)

# Scaling up
- Replicate the same thing for other brands.
- Shopee: might need more App for each brand.
- Backend: should scale to accommodate 16 brands

# Reliability
- DATA NOT MATCHED. Check if order data matches that of Shopee's. (try comparing first & last order)
    - Order is not sorted by datetime
    - Earliest order fetched is 2025-09-01 07:00, should be 00:00
    - Latest order fetched has id 250924A236C19G and IS factually correct. 
- Auto-retrying operations if network is bad or fails the first time.

# Notes
- time_from and time_to on v2.order.get_order_list spans at maximum 15 days,
should think of the workaround

Should make two requests if date of the month is > 17. 

Workaround:
Multiple requests. Check the month and year first.
If 30-day month, make two 15-day request.
Else if 31-day month, make two 15-day request and one 1-day request.
Else if 28-day or 29-day month, make a 15-day request and 13 or 14-day request.

- page_size: the number of orders fetched are limited at 100 per request, 
should think of the workaround

Using response parameters "more" and "next_cursor" to make multiple requests until it is done.
