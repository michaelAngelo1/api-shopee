# How Orders Are Fetched
- On the first day of the month, the whole previous month's orders are fetched.
    - On October 1st, orders from 1 - 30 Sept are fetched.
- The equation: firstDayOfTheMonth until currentDay - 1 (yesterday)

# Notes
- time_from and time_to on v2.order.get_order_list spans at maximum 15 days,
should think of the workaround

Should make two requests if date of the month is > 17. 

Workaround:
Multiple requests. Check the month and year first.
If 30-day month, make two 15-day request.
Else if 31-day month, make two 15-day request and one 1-day request.
Else if 28-day or 29-day month, make a 15-day request and 13 or 14-day request.

- page_size: the number of orders fetched are limited at 100 per request, 
should think of the workaround

Using response parameters "more" and "next_cursor" to make multiple requests until it is done.
